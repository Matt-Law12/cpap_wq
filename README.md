## Background
The FDEP Central Panhandle Aquatic Preserves (CPAP) conducts continual water chemisty data collection through the use of YSI EXO2 data sondes. These dataloggers collect temperature, depth, specific conductivity, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidiy data continually across 15 minute intervals at our two established stations, Alligator Harbor (designated AH2), and Windmark (designated WD).

## Why it Matters
Having access to continual water quality data in our bays provides numerous benefits, including:

• Preventing data gaps and anomalies that come with manual sampling. <br />
• Providing us with necessary data to make informed decisions regarding biological research we conduct in these bays. <br />
• Seeing how the water in our bays are responding to external factors such as changes in riverine flow and weather activity. <br />

## How We Collect Our Data

Our data sondes are contained within a PVC housing pipe mounted vertically to a designated channel marker. Once a month the dataloggers are retrieved, downloaded, cleaned, and inspected. Freshly calibrated units are deployed at the same time, resulting in little or no data gaps in collection intervals. These dataloggers go through both a pre- and post- calibration process to ensure the sensors are accurately recording data. 

Upon retreaval, datalogger deployment data is uploaded from the YSI data sonde and undergoes a quality assurance/quality control (QAQC) process. During the QAQC process, anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to flag or reject the suspect values. Data outside the "normal" range of water quality parameters for each site are investigated for validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks, graphs, and instrument diagnostics. Data are rejected if the anomalies are attributed to sensor malfunction and/or excessive fouling. In addition to observations of any physical damage (e.g., compromised DO probe membrane), sensor malfunctions are detected if the reading of the probe is outside the range established for the sensor or the sensor will not post calibrate.

All of our EXO2 monitoring data has been compiled into an [interactive Power BI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZGUzNTIyZGMtNjhjMy00NWVmLWJmMGItMmQ3ZWZjZTkxMjY5IiwidCI6ImI2MjAxOTYwLTQ1YmEtNGI3OC1iMDgwLWYxYzQzM2ZmNmUzNiIsImMiOjZ9), which contains all observed data that has not been rejected due to anomalies in the data collection process. This dashboard provides easy access to our water quality monitoring data in a way that is accessible, while also being detailed enough to support scientific and technical analysis.
